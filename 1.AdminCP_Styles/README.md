# AdminCP Styles

> **Note: vBulletin Cloud does not allow customization of the AdminCP.**

A variety of styles to recolor your AdminCP. If you want something different, then these styles are for you.

## Installation

Each style is contained in its own directory. Copy this directory to the /core/cpstyles/ directory of your installation.

## Selection

You can choose the style to use in two different ways.

1. When you sign into the AdminCP, click the Options button and select your chosen style from the drop down that appears.
1. In the AdminCP, go to Usergroups -> Administrator Permissions. Edit your user and set the style you want.
