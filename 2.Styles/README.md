# vBulletin 5 Styles

A variety of styles for vBulletin 5. My styles are designed to enhance your community experience with the vBulletin Community Style[<sup>{1}</sup>](#footnote-1). Each of the other styles will build off this one but can also be installed independently.

## Installation

### vBulletin Connect

### vBulletin Cloud

Installation on Cloud is a bit different as you don't have the ability to upload images via SFTP. These steps will help you install these themes.

## Professional Installation

All Themes can be professionally installed for between $20.00 and $30.00. To purchase, the professional installation, click the appropriate button on the Theme's description page within the Rabid Badger Add-on Gallery.[<sup>{2}</sup>](#footnote-2)

> Note: Professional Installation includes three months of support for that specific style.

## Support

Support is available on the [Rabid Badger Forums](https://forums.rabidbadger.io). To purchase support, you will need to purchase either the 6-month ($49.95) or 1 year ($79.95) subscription on the Support tab of your user settings page.[<sup>{2}</sup>](#footnote-2) Purchase of a support contract provides access to individual discussions for every style and add-on that we have available as well as one-on-one access to me through private message chat.

You may also purchase a one-time hour of support for $20.00 on your Support Page.

> Note: These support fees only cover Rabid Badger Add-ons and Styles. It does not give access to support for general administration of the vBulletin software.
