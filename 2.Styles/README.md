# vBulletin 5 Styles

A variety of styles for vBulletin 5. My styles are designed to enhance your community experience with the vBulletin Community Style[<sup>{1}</sup>](#footnote-1). Each of the other styles will build off this one but can also be installed independently.

## Installation

### vBulletin Connect

1. Download the Style Package to your local computer.
2. Unzip the Style Package.
3. Import the XML file included in the Style Package in your AdminCP.
    1. In the AdminCP go to Styles -> Download / Upload Styles.
    2. In the section labeled Import Style XML File, click the Choose File Button.
    3. Navigate to the XML file on your local hard drive and select it.
    4. Set "Ignore Style Version" to No.
    5. Enter in the Style Name in the "Title for Uploaded Style" field.
    6. Set the Display Order and Allow User Selection as you see fit.
    7. Ignore the other options in the form.
    8. Click Import.
4. Using SFTP, upload the /images/ directory in your Style Package to your /images/ directory on your vBulletin Connect server.

### vBulletin Cloud

Installation on Cloud is a bit different as you don't have the ability to upload images via SFTP. These steps will help you install these themes.

1. Download the Style Package to your local computer.
2. Unzip the Style Package.
3. Import the XML file included in the Style Package in your AdminCP.
    1. In the AdminCP go to Styles -> Download / Upload Styles.
    2. In the section labeled Import Style XML File, click the Choose File Button.
    3. Navigate to the XML file on your local hard drive and select it.
    4. Set "Ignore Style Version" to No.
    5. Enter in the Style Name in the "Title for Uploaded Style" field.
    6. Set the Display Order and Allow User Selection as you see fit.
    7. Ignore the other options in the form.
    8. Click Import.
4. In the AdminCP go to vBulletin Cloud File Manager.
    1. Upload all images in your style package. Note their URLs after uploading.
5. Find the "stylevar_replacement.md in your style package. This will list the style variables that have to be updated to include the images you uploaded above. Update each style variable listed.

## Professional Installation

All Themes can be professionally installed for between $20.00 and $30.00. To purchase, the professional installation, click the appropriate button on the Theme's description page within the Rabid Badger Add-on Gallery.[<sup>{2}</sup>](#footnote-2)

In order to perform a professional installation, I need the following items:

1. Access to SFTP on your vBulletin Site.
1. Access to your AdminCP with a user set up with the English Language and access to "Can Administer Styles.

> Note: Professional Installation includes three months of support for that specific style.

## Support

Support is available on the [Rabid Badger Forums](https://forums.rabidbadger.io). To purchase support, you will need to purchase either the 6-month ($49.95) or 1 year ($79.95) subscription on the Support tab of your user settings page.[<sup>{2}</sup>](#footnote-2) Purchase of a support contract provides access to individual discussions for every style and add-on that we have available as well as one-on-one access to me through private message chat.
